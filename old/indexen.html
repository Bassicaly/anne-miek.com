            WHAT IS OSTEOPATHY
          </h2><br>
          Osteopathy is a therapy which originated in America and makes it's
          way through England, France and Belgium to the Netherlands. The 7
          years of training is only allowed for physiotherapists and/or medical
          doctors. Founder of the osteopathy is Dr. A. Still (1828-1917). He
          discovered that any physical complaint is caused by a limitation of
          movement in one or more tissues of the human body:
          <ul>
            <li type="disc">joints, muscles, tendons/fascia and bones
            (parietal)
            </li>
            <li type="disc">viscera, nerves, glandula, blood- and lymph system
            (visceral)
            </li>
            <li type="disc">structures of the cranium (cranial)
            </li>
          </ul>All of these parts are connected with one another and will
          influence each other in a positive or negative way. A loss of
          mobility will cause less circulatory flow through the tissues and the
          consequences that go with it. Besides that, the body will compensate
          this loss of mobility at another part, what can cause to much strain
          on the tissues. In this way you create problem on problem and you can
          end up in a vicious circle. Therefore the key of an osteopathic
          treatment is a thoroughly built reasoning through extensive knowledge
          of the human physiology, anatomy, biomechanics, etc.<br>
          Osteopathy is a complete way of treatment; it not only looks into the
          symptoms or the complaint, but tries to find out where the problem is
          coming from.<br>
          <ul>
            <li>What is the real cause?
            </li>
            <li>What other parts of the body are involved?
            </li>
            <li>Which hidden problems or illnesses are connected?
            </li>
          </ul><br>
          <br>
          Some examples;<br>

                Headaches can be caused by head trauma, but also through
                tension in the head region or by problems of the neck, spine,
                pelvic area or even from organs.

                Backache can originate from a slipped disc. However, each part
                of the spine is also connected with our organs and can
                influence each other. Think e.g. of lower backache and problems
                with the womb.

            Treatment
          </h2><br>
          After an extensive questionnaire the osteopath will examine the
          entire body of the patient in search of lack of mobility. There are a
          number of techniques to relax the tissues involved. The osteopath
          will only be using his/her hands. The most common are:<br>
          <br>
          <h3>
            Manipulation
          </h3>The purpose is to release joint blockage or improve mobility in
          joint(s). Usually it's a quick and painless action.<br>
          <br>
          <h3>
            Organ- or visceral techniques
          </h3>By moving the organs and their surrounding tissues the
          circulation improves. Possible adhesions, for instance after surgery
          or when the womb is prolapsed, can be released.<br>
          <br>
          <h3>
            Head- or cranial techniques
          </h3>The skull (cranium) exists off numeral bones which will keep
          moving. These bones are connected with each other through sutures. If
          this was not the case, every fall on the head would result in a skull
          fracture. Attached on these sutures start membranes of connective
          tissue (fasciae), which run to all the body. They surround our brain,
          the spinal cord, the organs and all the muscles, nerves and blood
          vessels. This way an osteopath can, by working on the head, influence
          other parts of our body.<br>
